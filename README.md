# Online plants store

Fullstack e-commerce website that was created as part of a coding bootcamp, with no design provided. 

I developed the website using my own concept, using sample products and images.

In this project, I concentrated on creating an attractive and intuitive UI that mirrors the shopping experience found in real-world online stores. I designed a visually appealing interface that is both easy to use and accessible on a variety of devices. By focusing on user needs and following industry best practices, I ensured a smooth UX with a clear layout and consistent navigation. My goal was to build an interface that makes the website simple and enjoyable to use for all visitors.

The backend is a simple REST API, offering endpoints for products and orders, and is built using NestJS and MySQL.
